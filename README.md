<summary> RISC-V(Reduced Instruction Set Computing-Five) </summary>

- Open Standard: RISC-V is an open standard ISA, which means that its specifications are freely available to the public. This openness encourages collaboration, innovation, and the development of a wide range of processors by various organizations and individuals.
- Simplicity: RISC-V follows the RISC philosophy of simplicity and orthogonality. It has a relatively small number of instructions with a regular encoding format, making it easier to design and optimize processors.

<summary> From Apps to Hardware </summary> 

Application software ---> System software ---> Hardware

This Application Software enters into a block called as System Software and this system software intern converts application program into  binary language.
- Major components of system sofware are:
  1. OS(Operating System)
  2. Compiler
  3. Assembler
